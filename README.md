# Personal-Website

This project is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Computer Science student at Babeș-Bolyai University. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, focusing on clean design, responsiveness, and user-friendly navigation.
The portfolio highlights:

🎓 My background, education and skills

💻 Projects I’ve worked on

📩 Contact information

🌍 Links to my social media and GitHub profile

This project is a continuous work in progress, as I keep updating it with new skills and projects while I grow as a developer.
